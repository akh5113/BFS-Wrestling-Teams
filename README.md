Homework 5 - README

This program takes in a txt file of wrestlers, which lists their rivalries, 
and uses a breadth-first search algorithm to determine if it's possible to
designate some as "baby faces" and some as "heels", such that each rivalry is 
between a baby face and a heel. 

This program reads in a text file in the format: 
[number of players]
[player 1]
[player 2]
.
.
.
[player n]
[number of rivalries]
[rivalry 1]
[rivalry 2]
.
.
.
[rivalry n]

[comments]

This file will default to run with a text file called "wrestler.txt". To change
this, change the fileName variable in line 14

To run this program on flip, type: "python3 Homework5.py"
